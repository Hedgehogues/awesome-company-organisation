## [](https://continuous-architecture.org/)

The website [Continuous-Architecture.org](https://continuous-architecture.org/) focuses on an agile operating model for developing and operating digital products. It emphasizes guiding ideas, practices, rituals, and methods that differ from traditional enterprise architecture or agile frameworks. Key aspects include:

1. **Problem Discovery**: Emphasizing the importance of correctly framing problems to find effective solutions.
2. **Framework**: Offering tools and kits for success in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous environments. It combines intentional architecture and emergent design to balance team autonomy with alignment.
3. **Roles**: Defining specific roles within the Continuous Architecture operating model.
4. **Practices**: Providing a toolbox for teams to realize their architecture activities.
5. **Rituals**: Highlighting the importance of collaboration in architecture through key rituals.

The site also references the influence of works by Murat Erder and Pierre Pureur, the Open Agile Architecture™ Standard, the SAFe and Scaled Agile Framework, and the Domain-Design Design Crew (DDD-crew).


## [Continuous Architecture](https://continuousarchitecture.com/)

The website continuousarchitecture.com is centered around the concept of "Continuous Architecture in Practice." This concept is particularly relevant in the context of software architecture in the age of Agility and DevOps. The site appears to be a resource for the book "Continuous Architecture In Practice," which serves as a modern and practical guide to software architecture in this evolving technological era.

The website features a series of articles that provide practical advice and guidance on leveraging the Continuous Architecture approach. These articles cover various dimensions of Continuous Architecture, such as the speed of software delivery, scalability, and performance. For instance, one article discusses two key dimensions of Continuous Architecture: the speed of software delivery and its scale, highlighting the importance of rapid and scalable software development in modern architecture.

Another article in the series focuses on scalability as an architectural concern, providing definitions, discussing its importance, and its relation to other quality attributes. Additionally, the site delves into the essential activities of software architecture, which, along with principles and tools, form a crucial component of the Continuous Architecture approach.

Moreover, the website addresses performance as an architectural concern, starting with a definition and discussion on the topic, further emphasizing the role of performance in Continuous Architecture.

In summary, continuousarchitecture.com is a comprehensive resource dedicated to exploring and educating about Continuous Architecture in the context of Agile and DevOps practices, offering insights into various aspects like scalability, performance, and the essential activities involved in modern software architecture.


## https://scaledagileframework.com/
The website "scaledagileframework.com" is dedicated to the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) 6.0, a comprehensive knowledge base and methodology for achieving business agility through Lean, Agile, and DevOps practices. This framework is designed to help organizations adapt and thrive in the digital age by providing integrated principles, practices, and competencies. It includes seven core competencies of business agility:

Lean-Agile Leadership: Developing leadership skills that promote organizational change, empowering individuals and teams.
Team and Technical Agility: Creating high-performing Agile teams with strong technical practices.
Agile Product Delivery: Building teams that continuously deliver valuable products to customers.
Enterprise Solution Delivery: Developing and sustaining large software applications and solutions.
Lean Portfolio Management: Executing portfolio vision and strategy, with emphasis on Lean budgets and portfolio prioritization.
Organizational Agility: Aligning strategy and execution with Lean and systems thinking approaches.
Continuous Learning Culture: Encouraging continuous learning, improvement, and innovation within organizations.
SAFe 6.0 represents a significant advancement from its previous version (5.1), focusing on continuous value delivery to customers and incorporating modern elements like AI, Big Data, and Cloud technologies. It is tailored for various organizational sizes and complexities, ranging from the Essential configuration for smaller setups to the Full configuration for large enterprises with complex solutions.

The framework's creator, Dean Leffingwell, and other contributors, have developed SAFe to enable enterprises to respond effectively to market changes, evolving customer needs, and new technologies. SAFe's mission is rooted in the belief that better software and systems can improve the world, aiming to enable business agility through continuous customer value flow​

The GitHub repository "Domain-Driven Design Crew" focuses on providing resources and tools related to Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Key aspects of this repository include:

Welcome to DDD: This section offers definitions and fundamental concepts of DDD, aimed at reducing the learning curve and confusion for newcomers​​.

DDD Starter Modelling Process: It provides a step-by-step guide for those new to DDD, helping them understand where to start with DDD concepts and practices​​.

Aggregate Design Canvas: This is a structured approach for designing and documenting Aggregates, which are a key concept in DDD​​.

Bounded Context Canvas: Similar to the Aggregate Design Canvas, this provides a structured approach for designing and documenting Bounded Contexts, another central concept in DDD​​.

Free DDD Learning Resources: A collection of free resources for learning about DDD, making it accessible to a wider audience​​.

Overall, this repository seems to be a comprehensive resource for those interested in learning and implementing Domain-Driven Design in their projects or organizations.
